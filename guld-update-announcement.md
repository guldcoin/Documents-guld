# guld Releases, project Updates and Airdrop Announcement. 

Dear guld community, open source collaborators and new members of the Blocktree.

Today we are excited to announce the launch of some of our newest initiatives, including legal, tech, and social updates on our ongoing projects. 

We would also like to give a warm welcome to the newest members of our community, namely our [open source collaborators](https://github.com/guldcoin/ledger-guld/issues) whose crucial work on free software tools have made the creation of [guld](http://guld.io) possible.

GULD grants have been created and awarded to our Open Source Collaborators as a literal "token" of our appreciation. Instructions on redeeming the airdrop event can be found below, and you may contact [our guld support telegram group](http://t.me/guldblocktree) for registration and redemption assistance. 

## Releases
Our newly released tools and experiences:

### guld.app 
Web Based Wallet. In browser transaction generation and submission. View user profiles, asset balance, aliases and expenses. Create and send pgp signed transactions for different tokens.

Perspectives(user or group accounts on the blocktree) can now be observed on [guld.app](http://guld.app). If you have been credited guld in the airdrop, or have a registered guld account, you may consult guld.app to verify information such as asset balances, public digital aliases we have for you, Income and Expenses registered on the blocktree ledger branch. This will also allow users to create transactions that can be cryptographically signed with the corresponding PGP Key, and submitted for processing right on the website. 

[our guld support telegram group is available for any question you may have of the usage of guld.app](http://t.me/guldblocktree)

### guld.legal contract library
We proudly present the [guld.legal](http://guld.legal) contract library. 
This P2P contract template library and core guld contracts are a product of the work done during the guld lawtech internship in June of 2018. 
Website Contains:
- Growing repository for guld network core contracts. 
- Growing repository of P2P standardized contracts for a wide range of uses from sales agreements and prenups to labour contracts, ready to print and use, or digitally sign with PGP or Blockchain Address.
- Available legal grants for law firms and law contributors will be published soon in this very [guld subreddit.](http://reddit.com/guldblocktree)


### GULD ERC20
Through the implementation of our [GULD ERC20 CONTRACT](https://guld.io/#about) new blockchain-blocktree interactions have been enabled, making the GULD token officially cross chain. 
GULD Tokens from the blocktree ledger can now be converted through guld smart contract into an ERC20 Ethereum token.

In order to convert your GULD to GULD ERC20 and have them sent to your Ethereum wallet, you can simply obtain a [contract format from GAI](http://t.me/guldai_bot). If you have any questions, don't hesitate to join the [guld telegram group](http://t.me/guldblocktree) for support
