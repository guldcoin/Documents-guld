# ATTENTION: ${ username } Airdrop ${ guldEquity } GULD

Hello, ${ username }

Your contributions to Open Source Projects have been used in the development of the [guld network](http://guld.io), and for this, we would like to present you with a ${ guldEquity } [GULD](https://github.com/guldcoin/legder-guld) reward.

### What is guld?

Guld is a peer to peer, cryptographic platform of contracting, witnessing and consensus for DAPPs, DAOs, digital identity, and trustless ledgers. Guld is free and open source, built on [git](https://git-scm.com/), [pgp](https://www.openpgp.org/), and [ledger-cli](https://ledger-cli.org). We always use open components, when available, remembering to push patches upstream.

### What is GULD?

[GULD](https://github.com/guldcoin/legder-guld) is a digital token native to the guld network.

New [GULD](https://github.com/guldcoin/legder-guld) are issued in grants to contributors like yourselves, in transactions like [this one](https://github.com/guldcoin/ledger-guld/blob/guld/guld/1496275200.dat).

All records on the guld blocktree are readable in human language, and are organized into name spaces for individuals, groups, devices, Crypto addresses, and even other blockchains. [GULD](https://github.com/guldcoin/legder-guld) tokens are required to be burned to register such names.

### How to claim your guld account and GULD Airdrop?

We created an account ${ username }, and airdropped ${ guldEquity } [GULD](https://github.com/guldcoin/legder-guld) tokens to it. In order to claim these tokens, you must verify your identity. This is the best information we have about you:

${ metadata }

Registration and claim can be done either using the [guld-cli javascript package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/guld-cli) or by visiting our [telegram group](t.me/guldblocktree), to interact with the wallet bot, Gai (@guldai_bot).

Once you have claimed your account, you will be able to make transactions and sign contracts using the CLI, libraries, or telegram bot. If you are an Ethereum user, you may also convert your [GULD](https://github.com/guldcoin/legder-guld) for [ERC20 GULD](https://etherscan.io/token/0x9847345de8b614c956146bbea549336d9c8d26b6).

Thank you for your contributions, and welcome to guld!
