## Overview

Guld uses ledger-cli as the official ledger format and processing engine. This document describes the specific format which is used in the parent guld groupâ€™s ledger, and is not meant to preclude alternate structures in child groups.

## Accounting Principles

Account 1 is always a top level guld name. 

Account 2 is one of the standard accounting categories: Assets, Liabilities, Income, Expenses, Equity.

Accounts 3 and onward are for subdividing the categories.

Assets are only spendable with the signature(s) of the key(s) belonging to the account 1 identity. Equity is never transferrable, but gives weight to votes by the account 1 identity in the name of an account 3 identity.
